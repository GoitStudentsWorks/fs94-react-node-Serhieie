## Project

The project is designed as an application called ToDoList. It provides the
ability to add different work zones, each of which can contain the necessary
number of columns. A column is a place to collect task cards that share a common
theme or are at the same stage of completion. Task cards can be assigned a
priority and a due date.

Users can create multiple work zones (boards) and easily switch between them.
This allows organizing different aspects of their activities within a single
application, maintaining convenience and order. Additionally, the application
allows assigning color labels for better visual organization of tasks, making it
easier to navigate through different zones and columns. The interface is
intuitive and user-friendly, making the use of ToDoList pleasant and efficient.
